# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Image Gin is an Obsidian plugin (TypeScript, `isDesktopOnly: true`) that generates AI images via Recraft, searches stock images via Freepik, and uploads/converts local images to ImageKit CDN — all driven from modals invoked by Obsidian commands.

## Commands

Package manager: **pnpm** (required — see `.npmrc`).

- `pnpm dev` — esbuild watch mode; rebuilds `main.js` + `styles.css` on change.
- `pnpm build` — type-check (`tsc -noEmit -skipLibCheck`) then production esbuild. Type errors fail the build.
- `pnpm setup` — runs `setup-plugin.mjs` to scaffold a new plugin from `plugin-config.yaml` (only relevant when forking this as a starter).
- `pnpm version` — bumps `manifest.json`/`versions.json` via `version-bump.mjs`.

There are **no tests** and **no lint script** in `package.json`, even though ESLint is configured (`.eslintrc`). Invoke ESLint directly (`pnpm exec eslint .`) if you need to lint.

To live-test in an Obsidian vault, symlink the repo into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/` (see README).

## Architecture

### Entry point lives at the repo root, not in `src/`

`main.ts` (root) is the Obsidian `Plugin` subclass. It only does three things in `onload()`: load settings, register the `ImageGinSettingTab`, and register four commands. Each command's callback simply opens one of the modals from `src/modals/`. **All real logic lives in modals and services** — `main.ts` should stay thin.

esbuild's entry point is `main.ts` at root; `tsconfig.json` is `noEmit` (esbuild produces the bundle, `tsc` only type-checks).

### Layered structure

```
main.ts                     Plugin shell, command registration
src/modals/                 UI — one Modal per command
src/services/               External API wrappers (Recraft, ImageKit, Freepik) + ImageCacheService
src/settings/settings.ts    All settings types + DEFAULT_SETTINGS + SettingTab UI (large, ~660 lines)
src/utils/                  yamlFrontmatter (regex-based), logger (singleton FileLogger)
src/types/                  Shared types + Obsidian module augmentation
src/styles/                 CSS (bundled separately into styles.css)
```

Modals receive `(app, plugin)` and reach into `plugin.settings` directly; services are constructed per-modal-action with the current settings snapshot.

### Settings shape

All settings are one flat object `ImageGinSettings` (see `src/settings/settings.ts`) with nested sub-objects per integration: `imageKit`, `freepik`, `imageCache`, `style`. `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` is the source of truth — `loadSettings()` merges loaded data on top. When adding a new field, update both the interface and `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.

The Settings tab also re-imports `ImageCacheService` lazily (dynamic `import()`) for the "Clear Cache" button — keep that pattern if adding similar admin actions to avoid eager-loading services into the settings UI.

## Conventions specific to this codebase

- **HTTP: use Obsidian's `requestUrl`, not `fetch`.** All services do this. Obsidian's environment lacks browser `fetch` semantics for CORS/CSP, and `FormData` is unavailable — `imagekitService.ts` builds multipart bodies manually with a hand-rolled boundary. Follow that pattern for any new uploads.
- **YAML frontmatter is parsed by hand with regex** in `src/utils/yamlFrontmatter.ts` — no `js-yaml` or similar dependency. Do not add a YAML library; extend the existing parser if needed.
- **Build externals**: `esbuild.config.mjs` externalizes `obsidian`, `electron`, all `@codemirror/*`, all `@lezer/*`, and Node builtins. Anything you import from those will resolve at runtime in Obsidian — do not try to bundle them.
- **CSS is built separately**: `src/styles/current-file-modal.css` is the CSS entry point; esbuild emits `styles.css` at the repo root (which Obsidian loads). New stylesheets must be `@import`ed from there to ship.
- **TypeScript is very strict**: `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `useUnknownInCatchVariables` are all on. Prefer `null` over `undefined` for optional state (see `StyleSettings.customStyleId`). The build will fail on unused locals/params.
- **Obsidian module augmentation** lives in `src/types/obsidian.d.ts` — extend it there rather than casting to `any` when Obsidian's public types are missing something.

## Working with this repo (from `.windsurfrules.md`)

The previous AI-collaboration rules emphasize:
- Don't introduce new dependencies — propose them in chat first.
- Don't create config files or rename things on your own initiative; this project has established locations and naming. Search before creating.
- Make incremental, targeted changes; do not "rewrite from scratch" or do broad refactors without explicit approval.
- Use the exact library versions pinned in `package.json`.

## Local RAG over the Lossless corpus (ChromaDB)

A local Chroma database is wired into Claude Code via the `chroma` MCP server. Four collections aggregate prior Lossless work across the whole tree:

- `context-vigilance-corpus` — section-chunked `context-v/` files across every repo
- `lossless-changelog`        — every `<repo>/changelog/` entry, cross-repo
- `claude-code-sessions`      — every prior Claude Code message turn
- `claude-code-tool-traces`   — every prior tool invocation, with success/error flag

**Use it before answering from training data.** When the user asks a question that prior work might answer — *"what did we decide about X"*, *"when did we ship X"*, *"why did we choose X over Y"*, *"has this errored before"*, *"where did we put X"* — call `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents` against the most relevant collection (start with `n_results=5`). If results cover the question, synthesize an answer and cite `source_path` + timestamp + `source_repo_slug` for every claim. If there is a gap, run one more focused query. **Cap at 5 chroma queries per question** — if the corpus has no answer, say so explicitly rather than silently falling back to training data.

The full algorithm (decompose → execute → evaluate → synthesize, plus `where`-filter patterns, anti-patterns, and when NOT to use it) lives in the `search-lossless-corpus` skill, which auto-loads when the question matches the trigger shapes. This block is the backstop so the corpus is known to exist even when the skill description does not match.

Ingestion lives under `ai-labs/context-vigilance-kit/scripts/` (`ingest-all.sh` is the master). Do not re-ingest as a side effect of unrelated work — the user runs it deliberately.

## Browser-drive verification (Playwright MCP + Claude Chrome)

Agents verify UI work by driving a real browser BEFORE asking a human to walk the surface. Two tiers:

- **Codified (default): Playwright MCP** — navigate/click/type, accessibility-tree snapshots, DOM assertions; headless-capable, runs unwatched. Wire it per repo at **project scope** (config lands in the committed `.mcp.json`):

  ```bash
  claude mcp add -s project playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
  ```

- **Interactive: `claude --chrome`** (or `/chrome` → enable by default) — Claude drives the operator's real Chrome while they watch; screenshots/GIFs + console and network logs.

Rules that make it safe and cheap:

1. Newly added MCP servers load in the **next** session, not the current one (same rule as skills symlinks).
2. Prefer **accessibility snapshots over screenshots** — raster is token-expensive; use it only for visual questions (layout, theme).
3. Browser-driven **reads are unrestricted; writes only against the repo's designated safe target** — never mint test entities in shared/canonical data.
4. The drive's click-path is **named in the phase plan before implementation**; a drive that lives only in a session transcript is not codified.
5. A browser drive proves the buttons **work**; the human walk-through still judges whether the surface is **usable**. It augments the human rung, never replaces it.

Full pattern: `context-v/blueprints/Browser-Drive-Verification-For-Agent-Sessions.md` at the anchor monorepo root (kit rollout draft: `ai-labs/context-vigilance-kit/context-v/blueprints/`). Loop integration proven in `ai-labs/augment-it/context-v/loops/`.
