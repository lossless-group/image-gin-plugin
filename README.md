## Getting Started

If you want to use the `setup-plugin.mjs` script, fill out `plugin-config.yaml` and then make it an executable file. 

```bash
chmod +x setup-plugin.mjs
```

When run, it will create the basic metadata and fill in the template variables.  If you don't need it, just delete it and happy hacking.

Run the script with 

```bash
node setup-plugin.mjs
```

pnpm install
pnpm add -D esbuild @types/node builtin-modules
pnpm build

## Using Symbolic Links to Test Your Plugin

If you're like us, you have a directory housing all your code projects. To use your plugin as you develop it, just create a symbolic link. Here is my example, but you will need to use your own path structure:

```bash
ln -s /Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/obsidian-plugin-starter /Users/mpstaton/content-md/lossless/.obsidian/plugins/
```
